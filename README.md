# GameOfLife
- Minimalistic Game of Life Engine **FOR WINDOWS ONLY**
- Developed by Tom Wright at Icosicon

##Getting Started

Here's how to get started with the Icosicon Game of Life Engine

###Download
Download an installer for the [latest version](https://github.com/Icosicon/GameOfLife/releases/latest) of GoLE;
Choose ~~either an executable installer or~~ (installers incomplete) a zipped folder (either x86 or x64 [depending on your system](http://support.wdc.com/knowledgebase/answer.aspx?ID=9405))

###Installing Using Zipped Folder
1. Locate the downloaded zipped folder
2. Extract the files to wherever's convenient (we recommend `C:/Program Files`)\*
3. Run **`Game of Life.exe`** to boot up the program
4. If you want to, create a shortcut to **`Game of Life.exe`** on your **desktop** (`C:\Users\user\Desktop\`) and/or **start menu** (`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\`)

\**GoLE can be used as a portable application provided the architecture (x86/x64) is correct for the system in use*

###Installing Using Installer
1. ~~Locate the downloaded installer application~~
2. ~~Run the installer application and grant necessary permissions~~
3. ~~Follow the installer application through various steps to install GoLE~~
  * ~~Customization of shortcuts and output folders is available~~
4. ~~If you chose to add a start menu (off by default) or desktop shortcut (off by default) use these to run the main executable~~
5. ~~If not, navigate to the folder in which you chose to install the program, and run **`Game of Life.exe`** to boot up GoLE~~

(*installers incomplete*)
